Streaming Video Server programmed in PHP

The server codes all the videos to streaming to the TerrassaTSC website and the iPhone's app. It allows to load videos and introduce the metadata. Once loaded it codes the video in different qualities (web, iPhone high, iPhone std, iPhone low) and an XML file with all the metadata. Server also allows to create new Topics and Categories on the SQL database. 
Video can be played on the website or on the iPhone's app.
